# Project Title: Agile Manager

## What and Why

Agile Manager is a system designed to help teams manage their projects with Scrum. It will allow teams to track the progress and prioritize tasks, while collaborating and communicating with ease.

Agile Manager solves the lack of straightforward effective project tools for teams using Scrum methodology. The existing tools are either too complex or too simple, which makes it difficult for teams to implement Agile and achieve their goals.

## For Whom

Agile Manager is for us, and anyone who wants to implement Scrum to manage projects, including product owners, scrum masters, developers and stakeholders.

## How

Agile Manager will provide an interactive user interface to track the progress of tasks, editing specifications of each story, sorting and filtering them based on relevance and importance. Most importantly, Agile Manager will allow teams to collaborate in real time.

## Scope

Agile Manager will require a user-friendly interactive frontend, and a robust backend to store and manage project data.
